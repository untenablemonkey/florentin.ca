        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Florentin von Frankenberg, a Product Manager and engineer with a passion for finding creative ways that technology can solve human problems.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Professional Background Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>I have a background in mechatronics, specializing in Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While I have a deep appreciation for the technical details, my passion lies in understanding complex problems and driving the vision that leads to their solutions. As a Product Manager, I’m drawn to the challenge of transforming insights into direction—ensuring that teams stay aligned on value while navigating the intricacies of technical and user needs.</p>
            <p>A good Product Manager balances vision with pragmatism, and I believe my technical roots help me bridge gaps between engineering and business objectives. This shared language with engineers allows me to connect with various stakeholders, ensuring that everyone from developers to executives can see the ‘why’ behind our decisions and feel part of the mission.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Personal Passions Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Personal Passions</h2>
            <p>Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring the outdoors, riding motorcycles, or working on innovative personal transportation projects.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Core Values Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Core Values</h2>
            <p><strong>Curiosity:</strong> I believe that curiosity is one of the most valuable states of mind to cultivate. Every sentence that begins with "I wonder..." opens doors to growth, discovery, and new perspectives. This mindset fuels continuous learning and drives me to approach challenges with an open, inquisitive spirit.</p>
            <p><strong>Embracing Difference:</strong> Diversity, whether in thought patterns, culture, or problem-solving approach, holds inherent value. I see out-of-the-box thinking and unique perspectives as essential for innovation. Where information patterns vary, there is potential for insight—by weighing the good against the bad, we find ways to make things better. Differences drive progress, and I’m committed to exploring them with curiosity to drive positive change.</p>
